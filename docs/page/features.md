represents the list of the active sessions.

## Locals

Locals can be viewed after invoking `dap-ui-locals`.

## Expressions

Watch expressions can be viewed after invoking `dap-ui-expressions`. You
could add remove watch expressions via `dap-ui-expressions-add` and
`dap-ui-expressions-remove`.

## Loaded sources

Loaded sources can be viewed by invoking `dap-tm-loaded-sources`.

## DAP debug REPL

DAP provides a debug shell to execute commands when the program has hit
breakpoints. The REPL has the same features as regular emacs shells
(e.g. command history, `C-p/n` navigation through history, etc.) in
addition to optional `company-mode` autocompletion.

## launch.json support

DAP supports `launch.json` files out of the box, and there is nothing that needs
to be enabled. All that needs to be done is to add a `launch.json` file at the
project root and to run `dap-debug`. All configurations stored in the
`launch.json` will automatically show up in the selection. `launch.json` files in
DAP are just like in VSCode and even support variables. See:

- [launch.json](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging)
- [launch.json variables](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/variables-reference)
