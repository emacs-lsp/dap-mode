Configuration
===============

## DAP mode configuration

For an auto-configuration enable the `dap-auto-configure-mode`. You can configure which features from `dap-mode` do you want with `dap-auto-configure-features`:

```elisp
;; Enabling only some features
(setq dap-auto-configure-features '(sessions locals controls tooltip))
```

Or if you want to enable only specific modes instead:

```elisp
(dap-mode 1)

;; The modes below are optional

(dap-ui-mode 1)
;; enables mouse hover support
(dap-tooltip-mode 1)
;; use tooltips for mouse hover
;; if it is not enabled `dap-mode' will use the minibuffer.
(tooltip-mode 1)
;; displays floating panel with debug buttons
;; requies emacs 26+
(dap-ui-controls-mode 1)
```

After enabling DAP mode on emacs side follow the language specific
settings.

## Java

1.  Installation

    Latest version of [LSP Java](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-java)
    will automatically discover if `dap-mode` is present and it will
    download and install the required server side components. If you
    have already downloaded a `Eclispe JDT Server` you will have to
    force a server update via <kbd>C-u</kbd> <kbd>M-x</kbd> `lsp-install-server` and select
    "jdtls". In order to enable lsp java, you will have to require
    `dap-java.el`.

    ``` elisp
    (require 'dap-java)
    ```

2.  Commands

    | Command                      | Description       |
    | ---------------------------- | ----------------- |
    | `dap-java-debug`             | Debug java        |
    | `dap-java-run-test-method`   | Run test method   |
    | `dap-java-debug-test-method` | Debug test method |
    | `dap-java-run-test-class`    | Run test class    |
    | `dap-java-debug-test-class`  | Debug test class  |


    You can also edit one of the existing templates and execute it with
    `dap-debug`. dap-mode will take care of filling missing values, such
    as classpath. JVM arguments can be specified with `:vmArgs`:

    ``` elisp
    (dap-register-debug-template "My Runner"
                                 (list :type "java"
                                       :request "launch"
                                       :args ""
                                       :vmArgs "-ea -Dmyapp.instance.name=myapp_1"
                                       :projectName "myapp"
                                       :mainClass "com.domain.AppRunner"
                                       :env '(("DEV" . "1"))))
    ```

## Kotlin

1.  Installation 
    To use dap-mode with Kotlin, you need to download the [kotlin-debug-adapter](https://github.com/fwcd/kotlin-debug-adapter). 
    The releases are a bit infrequent, so it is recommended to build it from source yourself.
    You will also need to have installed `lsp-mode`, as `dap-kotlin` shares some configuration with it.
    After building it, point the variable `lsp-kotlin-debug-adapter-path ` to the path of the kotlin-debug-adapter executable.
    You will find this in the path `adapter/build/install/adapter/bin` (from the kotlin-debug-adapter root).
    You should also make sure that `lsp-kotlin-debug-adapter-enabled` is set to true.

2.  Usage
    **First of all, each time you you want to debug, make sure you BUILD YOUR PROJECT FIRST!**
    Simply running your regular build with Maven or Gradle should be enough.
    
    You can set up debug templates using Kotlin. `dap-kotlin`provides some sensible defaults, 
    but there are one parameters you MUST give yourself:
    - `:mainClass`: The class name, including package for the main class you want to run. If the class takes argument, you can give them as well.
    If project root path needs to be different, you can give it using the parameter `:projectRoot`. 
    Other parameters include:
    - `:type`: `launch` or `attach`
    - `:hostName`: If type is `attach`, you can specify a hostname to connect to. Defaults to `localhost`.
    - `:port`: If type is `attach`, you can specify a port to connect to. Defaults to `5005`.
    - `:noDebug`: Whether or not to use a debug session
    - `:enableJsonLogging`: Enable logging of adapter communication logs.
    - `:jsonLogFile`: File to log to.
   
   
   Thanks to interop with `lsp-kotlin`, you can have it set up code lenses with run/debug-options for main classes.
   For this to work, you need kotlin-langauge-server running, be in a file with a main method, and have activated `lsp-kotlin-lens-mode`
   
   Sadly, there is no test-running functionality like in Java `dap-mode`. This can be combated by setting up a debug template with
   the Junit5 `ConsoleLauncher`. Remember that this class needs to be part of your classpath. Sometimes this is included in bigger frameworks
   testing utilities, but can also be included explicitly by adding the `junit-platform-console` dependency.
   
   ```elisp
   (dap-register-debug-template "Kotlin tests with launcher"
                             (list :type "kotlin"
                                   :request "launch"
                                   :mainClass "org.junit.platform.console.ConsoleLauncher --scan-class-path"
                                   :enableJsonLogging nil
                                   :noDebug nil))
   ```
   This will run all tests in the projects in debug mode, with no json logging. You can experiment with the 
   arguments to `ConsoleLauncher`. Arguments are documented on [the official JUnit website](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#running-tests-console-launcher-options).
   

## Python

1.  Installation

	Make sure to install the required modules in the project's virtual
    environment (if any).

    - install debugpy
    ``` bash
    pip install "debugpy"
    ```
	- Or install ptvsd
	```bash
	pip install "ptvsd>=4.2"
	```
	NOTE: ptvsd is depracated, and as of 8/10/2022, ptvsd caused dap to break when it hits a breakpoint.
	This comment and issue has context: https://github.com/emacs-lsp/dap-mode/issues/625#issuecomment-1128961454

    - Then add the following line in your config:
    ```elisp
    (require 'dap-python)
    ;; if you installed debugpy, you need to set this
    ;; https://github.com/emacs-lsp/dap-mode/issues/306
    (setq dap-python-debugger 'debugpy)
    ```
    This will add the python related configuration to `dap-debug`.

2.  Usage

    A template named "Python :: Run Configuration" will appear, which
    will execute the currently visited module. This will fall short
    whenever you need to specify arguments, environment variables or
    execute a setuptools based script. In such case, define a template:

    ``` elisp
    (dap-register-debug-template "My App"
      (list :type "python"
            :args "-i"
            :cwd nil
            :env '(("DEBUG" . "1"))
            :target-module (expand-file-name "~/src/myapp/.env/bin/myapp")
            :request "launch"
            :name "My App"))
    ```

3. Template parameters

These parameters are handled by templates of type `python`:

- `:target-module`: path to some python file to be executed
                    (supersedes `:program`)
- `:program`: path to some python script/program to be executed
              (defaults to the buffer's file-name)
- `:module`: Python module to be executed using `-m â€¦`.
             If given, this will be added to the argument list in
             front of program resp. target-module.
- `:args`: either a string or a list of strings (`["foo" "bar"]`)
           If a string, it will be split into arguments and shell-unqouted.
- `:debugger`: Debugger to use, either `"debugpy"` or `"ptvsd"`
               (defaults to the value defined in `dap-python-debugger`)

Remaining parameters are forwarded to the respective debugger.


## Ruby

  - Download and extract [VSCode Ruby
    Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rebornix.Ruby).
    You can do that either by:

      - Calling `dap-ruby-setup`, the extension will be downloaded and
        all your path will be automatically set up.
      - Or download the extension manually. Make sure that
        `dap-ruby-debug-program` is: `("node" path-to-main-js)` where
        `node` is either "node" if nodejs is on the path or path to
        nodejs and `path-to-main-js` is full path
        `./dist/debugger/main.js` which is part of the downloaded VScode
        package.

    ```

    Then do `dap-debug` or `dap-debug-edit-template` and selet GBD or
    LLDB configuration.
    
### Rust
To fully support rust and pretty printing of strings when debugging, remember to add set `gdbpath` to `rust-gdb` in your debug template. An example template would be

```elisp
(dap-register-debug-template "Rust::GDB Run Configuration"
                             (list :type "gdb"
                                   :request "launch"
                                   :name "GDB::Run"
                		   :gdbpath "rust-gdb"
                                   :target nil
                                   :cwd nil))
```

## Go

      - install gopls

      - Install the delve command by following instructions on [delve -
        installation](https://github.com/go-delve/delve/tree/master/Documentation/installation).

      - install lsp-mode

      - Put in your emacs configuration.

        ``` elisp
        (require 'dap-dlv-go)
        ```
    <!-- end list -->

    1.  Usage

        assume you have your code at \~/src/cool/cmd/app/app.go

          - open your main package file e.g \~/src/cool/cmd/app/app.go
          - or open a test file e.g app<sub>test</sub>.go
          - add folder to lsp session where your go.mod is or would be
              - M-x lsp-workspace-folders-add \~/src/cool
          - set break point
          - M-x dap-debug
          - if you want to launch a binary or test to debug, use "Go
            Dlv Launch File Configuration"
          - if you want to debug current test function inside test
            file use "Go Dlv Test Current Function Configuration"
          - if you want to debug current subtest put your cursor on this
            subtest and use "Go Dlv Test Current Subtest Configuration"
          - if you want to debug already running application select
            "Go Dlv Attach Configuration"
          - if you want to debug binary and need to interact with your
            application, install `vterm` package and call `M-x`
            `dap-dlv-go-debug-in-vterm`. If you need to add arguments
            to your command, use `C-u` `M-x` `dap-dlv-go-debug-in-vterm`
          - if you want to debug remote application you need start
            delve on remote machine first, for example: `dlv --headless
            --accept-multiclient attach 123 -l :1080` (see [dlv usage
            documentation](https://github.com/go-delve/delve/tree/master/Documentation/usage#using-delve)
            for more command-line options) and select "Go Dlv Remote Debug"
          - if your build environment differs from your development
            environment (for example, you build project inside docker
            container or in CI pipeline) or you use `-trimpath` build
            flag you can use `substitutePath`. `M-x`
            `dap-debug-edit-template` then select some template and
            add `substitutePath` option to it:
            ```elisp
            (dap-register-debug-template
             "Launch Executable trimmed path"
             (list :type "go"
                   :request "launch"
                   :name "Launch Executable trimmed path"
                   :mode "exec"
                   :program nil
                   :args nil
                   :env nil
                   :substitutePath (vector (ht ("from" "/home/user/projects/tribonacci") ("to" "github.com/s-kostyaev/tribonacci")))))
            ```
            and after evaluation you can select this edited template
            and debug as usual. You also can use
            [dir-locals](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Directory-Variables.html)
            to save this template for your project. Create
            `.dir-locals.el` in root directory of your project:
			```elisp
            ((go-mode  . ((eval . (progn
                                    (dap-register-debug-template
                                     "Remote debug in docker container"
                                     (list :type "go"
                                           :request "attach"
                                           :name "Remote debug in docker container"
                                           :mode "remote"
                                           :substitutePath (vector (ht ("from" "/home/user/projects/tribonacci") ("to" "/app"))))))))))
            ```
	    If you need to provide build flags, use `:buildFlags` key.

    2.  Trouble shooting

          - put (setq dap-print-io t) and check messages buffer
          - add `--log --log-output debugger,rpc,dap` to `dlv` command
            and check `dlv` logs
          - e.g linter can return note at debug session response
            resulting debug session to fail
