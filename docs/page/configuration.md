Configuration
===============

## DAP mode configuration

For an auto-configuration enable the `dap-auto-configure-mode`. You can configure which features from `dap-mode` do you want with `dap-auto-configure-features`:

```elisp
;; Enabling only some features
(setq dap-auto-configure-features '(sessions locals controls tooltip))
```

Or if you want to enable only specific modes instead:

```elisp
(dap-mode 1)

;; The modes below are optional

(dap-ui-mode 1)
;; enables mouse hover support
(dap-tooltip-mode 1)
;; use tooltips for mouse hover
;; if it is not enabled `dap-mode' will use the minibuffer.
(tooltip-mode 1)
;; displays floating panel with debug buttons
;; requies emacs 26+
(dap-ui-controls-mode 1)
```

After enabling DAP mode on emacs side follow the language specific
settings.

## Java

1.  Installation

    Latest version of [LSP Java](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-java)
    will automatically discover if `dap-mode` is present and it will
    download and install the required server side components. If you
    have already downloaded a `Eclispe JDT Server` you will have to
    force a server update via <kbd>C-u</kbd> <kbd>M-x</kbd> `lsp-install-server` and select
    "jdtls". In order to enable lsp java, you will have to require
    `dap-java.el`.

    ``` elisp
    (require 'dap-java)
    ```

2.  Commands

    | Command                      | Description       |
    | ---------------------------- | ----------------- |
    | `dap-java-debug`             | Debug java        |
    | `dap-java-run-test-method`   | Run test method   |
    | `dap-java-debug-test-method` | Debug test method |
    | `dap-java-run-test-class`    | Run test class    |
    | `dap-java-debug-test-class`  | Debug test class  |


    You can also edit one of the existing templates and execute it with
    `dap-debug`. dap-mode will take care of filling missing values, such
    as classpath. JVM arguments can be specified with `:vmArgs`:

    ``` elisp
    (dap-register-debug-template "My Runner"
                                 (list :type "java"
                                       :request "launch"
                                       :args ""
                                       :vmArgs "-ea -Dmyapp.instance.name=myapp_1"
                                       :projectName "myapp"
                                       :mainClass "com.domain.AppRunner"
                                       :env '(("DEV" . "1"))))
    ```

## Python

1.  Installation

      - install latest version of ptvsd.

        ``` bash
        pip install "ptvsd>=4.2"
        ```

          - Then add the following line in your config:

            ``` elisp
            (require 'dap-python)
            ```

        This will add the python related configuration to `dap-debug`.

2.  Usage

    A template named "Python :: Run Configuration" will appear, which
    will execute the currently visited module. This will fall short
    whenever you need to specify arguments, environment variables or
    execute a setuptools based script. In such case, define a template:

    ``` elisp
    (dap-register-debug-template "My App"
      (list :type "python"
            :args "-i"
            :cwd nil
            :env '(("DEBUG" . "1"))
            :target-module (expand-file-name "~/src/myapp/.env/bin/myapp")
            :request "launch"
            :name "My App"))
    ```

## Ruby

  - Download and extract [VSCode Ruby
    Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rebornix.Ruby).
    You can do that either by:

      - Calling `dap-ruby-setup`, the extension will be downloaded and
        all your path will be automatically set up.
      - Or download the extension manually. Make sure that
        `dap-ruby-debug-program` is: `("node" path-to-main-js)` where
        `node` is either "node" if nodejs is on the path or path to
        nodejs and `path-to-main-js` is full path
        `./dist/debugger/main.js` which is part of the downloaded VScode
        package.

  - Follow the instructions on installing `rdebug-ide` from [Ruby Debug
    Installation](https://github.com/rubyide/vscode-ruby/wiki/1.-Debugger-Installation)

under linux with node.

``` elisp
(require 'dap-php)
```

Start debugging by selecting "PHP Run Configuration" from the
`dap-debug` menu, issue the debug request in your browser by choosing
the running thread (`dap-switch-thread`) and then `dap-step-in`.
