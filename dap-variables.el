  "Alist of (REGEX . VALUE) pairs listing variables usable in launch.json files.
This list is iterated from the top to bottom when expanding variables in the strings of the selected launch configuration
from launch.json or in `dap-variables-expand-variable'.

When a REGEX matches (`string-match'), its corresponding VALUE is
evaluated as follows: if it is a function (or a quoted lambda),
that function is called with `funcall', and its result, which
must be a string, is used in place of the variable. If you used
capture groups in REGEX, the function you specified in VALUE is
called with the variable as its only argument. This way, you can
use `string-match' to get the capture groups. If, however, REGEX
does not contain capture groups, your function is called without
any arguments. Otherwise, if it is a symbol, the symbol's value
is used the same way. Lastly, if it is a string, the string is
used as a replacement. If no regex matches, the empty string is
used as a replacement and a warning is issued.

See `dap-variables--launch-configuration-var-getenv' for an
example on how to use capture groups in REGEX.")
